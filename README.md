# Overview

This repository contains the c code for the paper Cell-type-specific DMR Detection]{Detection of Cell-type-specific Differentially Methylated Regions
in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.

# Introduction

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) aim to identify the
associations between the DNA methylation levels of (CpG) sites
and phenotypes of interest. EWAS data is aggregated from mixed cell types. It is of importance to do cell type deconvolution and detect the associations at the cell-type-specific levels. This paper aims to find the cell-type-specific risk CpG sites by leverage the information across nearby CpG sites. As a result, this proposed method can detect the Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs).
